standalone wikitext can't convert Confluence style markup

Steps To Reproduce:
Use ant to convert a Confluence style textile file to html.
The result is an class not found exception.

More information:
The problem is that inside of the confluence.core jar, there is a file:
META-INF/services/org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.core.parser.markup.MarkupLanguage
which has a classname in it which is incorrect.  It is missing the .core. from the package name.

After changing this package name it worked for me.

I found this bug in the standalone wikitext download here:
http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/downloads/
which gave me this version:
0.9.1.I20081118-0300-e3x

On a different note, the documentation for setting up the ant classpath is incorrect.  The pattern used does not match all of the jars files.

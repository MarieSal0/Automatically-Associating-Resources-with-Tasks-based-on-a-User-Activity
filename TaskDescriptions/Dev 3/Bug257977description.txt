[api] It would be useful for IInteractionContext to provide a means for knowing if something is interesting

while it is currently possible to know if something is interesting given an IInteractionContext, the current APIs make the code inefficient.  A new method on IInteractionContext would make the query easy and fast.

Suggested API change on @IInteractionContext@:

bc. 
	/**
	 * indicate if the interaction element identified by the given handle is interesting
	 * 
	 * @param elementHandle
	 *            the {@link IInteractionElement#getHandleIdentifier() handle identifier}
	 * 
	 * @return true if an {@link #getInteresting() interesting} interaction element exists with the given handle
	 */
	public boolean isInteresting(String elementHandle);

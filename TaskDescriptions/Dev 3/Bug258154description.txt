[wikitext] ValidationProjectBuilder.visit(..)'s implementation not compatible with eclipse 3.3

I loaded the source code from the team project set downloaded from http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylyn/Contributor_Reference#Checkout , and but ValidationProjectBuilder.visit(..) didn't compile (I am using 3.3 for my thesis) since IResource.isDerived(int) is a 3.4 specific API, 3.3 only has IResource.isDerived().

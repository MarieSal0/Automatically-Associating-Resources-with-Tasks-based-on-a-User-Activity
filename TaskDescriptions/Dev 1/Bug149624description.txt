[api] AbstractRepositoryTask repositoryUrl and task id should not be derived from handleIdentifier

AbstractRepositoryTask repositoryUrl and task id should not be derived from handleIdentifier. Current API is very confusing and does not give enough flexibility. For example in web provider I have repositoryUrl, task id and task prefix. In some cases (e.g. SourceForge) task prefix is defined per query.

Please refactor API to keep separate repositoryUrl, taskUrl (same as current handle identifier) and task id.

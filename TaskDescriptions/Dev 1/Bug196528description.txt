[api] AbstractRepositoryConnector.createTask() is not sufficient for creating tasks

AbstractRepositoryConnector.createTask() is not sufficient for creating tasks. For example, WebTask require additional task prefix that can't be set using this factory method. 

There is also ITaskFactory (bound to task data) and AbstractTaskListFactory (bound to XML DOM !?!?) that can be also used to create tasks and all quite confusing.

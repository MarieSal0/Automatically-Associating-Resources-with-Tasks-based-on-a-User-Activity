[api] merge IInteractionContextListener and IInteractionContextListener2 into AbstractContextListener

IInteractionContextListener and IInteractionContextListener2 should be merged into one class. It would be good to create an  InteractionContextAdapter at the same time since most clients only overwrite one or very methods.

[api] Generalize screen capture UI and other common facilities for cross-project use

Currently Mylyn has a wizard-based screen capture user interface.  Several other projects (e.g. ECF) have the need for a screen capture UI for different purposes (in ECF's case, for transmission to others via IM rather than/in addition to saving to file).

For user simplicity, it would be helpful to have one (extensible) user interface for doing screen capture.  It would allow some amount of flexibility on how/what of the screen was captured (e.g. the entire display, workbench, view, selected screen region), how much time delay before the shot is actually taken, and perhaps some basic/flexible editing capabilities (e.g. bug#195691, bug#209897, bug#210020, bug#210179).

For ECF's use cases, it would be helpful to have much of the screen capture user interface be optionally displayed/used, in order to keep the usage easy and lightweight.  Further, it would be desirable to have minimal dependencies on non-swt or jface plugins so that multiple environment (i.e. non-Eclipse) usage is possible.

deadlock in ContextCorePlugin.start

org.eclipse.mylar.context.core.ContextCorePlugin.start can deadlock!
This seems to be a problem with sun java VMs. The problem comes from
the fact that ContextCorePlugin.start tries to create a executable extension. 

For details (including stack trace) see bug 188943. I filed this bug against equinox and they marked it as fixed:

I think this is a major bug, because the only way to get out of the deadlock is to kill eclipse. It happend to me several times at startup.

I use org.eclipse.mylar.ide_feature_2.0.0.v20070403 with eclipse 3.3 M7

Eclipse Build ID: I20080523-0100
Mylyn 3.0.0.I200880526
Running on Fedora 9

Steps To Reproduce:
-From a fresh install of Mylyn 3.0.0.I200880526 on Eclipse 3.4RC2, installed via the Ganymede update site
1. Create a new (local) task, activate
2. Add elements to the context
3. Remove elements from the context
4. Deactivate/reactivate the task
5. Previously removed elements are still present


More information:
If the task is still active the elements are removed, but when reactivating the task any element previously in the context will appear. 

-Occurs with a single or multiple tasks present, including when switching between tasks

-Occurs if the element is removed via:
--the right-click menu "Remove From Context" in the package view
--closing the file from the editor
--right-click menu "Remove From Context" in the task rich editor

-Only the 'Clear Context' item in the task rich editor removes all elements permanently
